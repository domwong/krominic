            <p>We'll be thrilled for you to join us and celebrate our marriage so gifts are absolutely not necessary. If you'd still like to gift us something then we'd be super grateful for contributions to either our honeymoon or home funds. We're using PayPal to collect contributions so you'll need to sign up to an account if you don't have one.<br></p>

                <p>It's been a crazy year and we haven't had much time to think about our honeymoon yet. So as well as contributing to our honeymoon fund we'd love any suggestions of places to go or things to do.</p><p>Drop us your ideas in the notes section of PayPal. Perhaps Mauritius? Australia? Vietnam? Bognor Regis?</p>
