            <div class="audom">"Almost eight years ago, Krish started an internship at Morgan Stanley, where she was allocated a 'buddy' who had also completed an internship at the company."</div>
            <div class="aukrish">"This buddy was Dom!"</div>
            <div class="audom">"I was responsible for four interns and I was convinced that Krish would stay on at Morgan Stanley after her internship but she didn't ðŸ˜¢"</div>
            <div class="aukrish">"Yeah.....but some time towards the end of that internship I fell for Dom! A dissertation later..."</div>
            <div class="audom">"We got together! ðŸŽ‰"</div>
            <div class="aukrish">"On Halloween or what we now refer to as 'Halloween-a-versary'! ðŸ‘»"</div>
